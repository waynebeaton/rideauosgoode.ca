The tiny island of Okinawa—located in the East China Sea—was the birthplace of Karate. In the 11th century, the people of Okinawa developed their own fighting ability from the influence of Chinese Martial Arts and other asian fighting systems. While the origins of Goju Ryu and all Martial Arts dates back many centuries, the style that we know as Goju Ryu was only formalized in the early twentieth century. The Style Goju Ryu was named in 1931 by Miyagi Chojun Sensei, the student of Higaonna Kanryo Sensei. The parts in the name Goju Ryu can be broken down as such: **Go** - hard, **Ju** - soft, **Ryu** - the way. The name Goju Ryu reflects the nature of the style which has both hard and soft elements.

While Goju Ryu is the primary style of Karate taught at the Rideau Osgoode Martial Arts, we also do katas (patterns) from the Shotokan and Chito Ryu systems. Our instructors come from diverse backgrounds and we've decided to maintain some elements from that diversity to improve the overall knowledge and experience of our members.
