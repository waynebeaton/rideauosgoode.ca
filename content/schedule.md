With Ontario now in Stage Three of our COVID-19 Response, the Dojo is opening for in-person training, but with some significant change in the way that we structure and schedule classes. Please see [COVID -19 Safety Instruction Protocols](/covid) for more information.

Note that we are still running online (virtual) sessions at 7:00 pm on Tuesday and Thursday nights. Links for these sessions are in the corresponding calendar entries below.

> Unfortunately we cannot facilitate drop-ins at this point-in-time. If you would like to attend one of these sessions, please send a note to [schedule@rideauosgoode.ca](schedule@rideauosgoode.ca) to book your spot.

## Upcoming Events and Classes

We have classes most days of the week. During the week, our classes are in the evening, generally starting at 6:30. The typical schedule of classes is listed below. Exceptions are noted in our calendar.
