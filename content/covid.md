The instructors of Rideau Osgoode Martial Arts take the safety of our members and instructors seriously. In this challenging time, we have made a purposeful decision to be more careful than the government rules and regulations require. We thank you for your patience as we all work together to optimize our collective training experience under these circumstances.

This document outlines the procedures and processes that Rideau Osgoode Martial Arts has put in place to protect its instructors and members during the COVID-19 crisis. 

For instruction and training purposes:

* No common equipment such as free weights, medicine balls, and mats may be used; 
* There must be no physical contact between instructors and members; and
* Physical distancing of at least 2m must be maintained between members who do not reside in the same household.

If members require equipment to, for example, participate in Kobudo, then the instructor will designate specific equipment for the exclusive use of the member. The equipment will be labelled and remain in the Dojo. The member will be responsible for cleaning their equipment when the training session completes.

The change rooms are not to be used. All members must arrive dressed in their training uniforms (Gis) and prepared for instruction.

Masks must be worn while transiting into and out of the Dojo. Masks may be removed while practicing social distancing during training.

Upon entry, members and instructors must assert, by signing in using the sheet provided, that they:

* Are COVID-19 symptom free;
* Have not been in close contact with someone who is sick or has confirmed COVID-19 in the past fourteen days; and 
* Have not returned from travel outside Canada in the past fourteen days or have otherwise been compelled to quarantine due to government rules and regulations.

No more than eight members and two instructors are permitted in the training area at any one time (the training area is approximately 150m<sup>2</sup> of space).

We have reconfigured the mats to designate individual training areas. Members must stay within their designated area. 

We will have two instructors in attendance for each class: one lead instructor and an assistant. The instructor working in the assistant role will fill the role of Facility Manager, responsible for managing the flow of members into the facility, registration, and ensuring that members conform to entry and exit protocols.

Members must ask permission to transit the training area during class (e.g., to go to the bathroom).

The schedule leaves fifteen minutes in between every class. This time is intended to be used to clean the Dojo and prepare for the arrival of the next class, so members must leave promptly (sadly, socialization will have to be kept to a minimum). Some members may be asked to assist with the clean up.

## Scheduling Your Session

Members must wear a mask while transiting into and out of the training area. Members must bring their own water bottles.

Observers must use the designated chairs. The chairs must not be moved.

## Exit Protocol

Members must wear a mask while transiting into and out of the training area. Members must bring their own water bottles.

 Members must ask permission from the instructor to leave the class to use the bathroom.

* One person at a time in the bathroom (parents may assist their own children);

## Clean up Protocol (after class)

Instructors will lead the clean up effort after every class. Members may be asked to assist.

* Cleaners must sanitize their hands before using cleaning tools;
* The cleaning tools must themselves be cleaned after use; 
* Wipe down all door handles and knobs, and other surfaces that have may have been contacted;
* Wipe down the facet, taps, toilet handle, and toilet seat (in that order); and
* Observe social distancing at all times.

## Clean up Protocol (weekly)

* Training area swept or vacuumed and mopped;
* Toilet cleaned; and
* All door knobs and handles wiped down.

## Instructor Guidance

* Review half-step every class as a strategy for students to stay within their designated area, before engaging in any activity that requires movement (e.g., during basics, before engaging in any kata);
* Only one person may leave the training area at a time to go to the bathroom; and
* Observe social distancing at all times.

## Signage

Signage will be displayed for:

* COVID_19 Symptoms (the City of Ottawa Child Care providers);
* Process to be followed;
