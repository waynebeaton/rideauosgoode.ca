For at least the next couple of weeks, all of our classes will be online.

Tonight, we're going to follow the schedule and run two 45 minute Karate classes, the first starting at 6pm and the second at 7pm.

We're not quite ready to run Kobudo online, so we're going to use tonight's regularly-scheduled 8pm Kobudo class as an advanced Black Belt class (Sandan and up).

All Friday or Saturday classes are canceled this week.

For next week...

Our current plan is to start online Kobudo next Monday night at 8pm and then (as regularly scheduled) at 7pm on Thursday.

We will run "All Belts" Karate online next Tuesday at 6pm and Thursday at 6pm and 7pm, and Brown and Black Belt Karate at 7pm on Tuesday. I'll send a note out with more updates as we settle in.
