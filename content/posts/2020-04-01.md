After our on-line karate class tomorrow (Wednesday, April 1) we are going to try an on-line Kobudo class, starting at 8pm.

We will focus on some bo basics and if time permits, we'll spend some time with sais as well.

For work with the bo, you must make sure that you have enough space to work without doing damage to your surroundings. We recommend that you find something shorter than a bo to practice with, like a broom handle, for example. Make sure that the space you work in has a minimum ceiling height of seven feet.

For sais, you can either use your sais if you have them at home, or we will show you how to practice empty-hand.

See you in the virtual dojo!

Wash your hands!
