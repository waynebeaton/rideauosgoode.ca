Our online classes focus on the many aspects of Karate that we can practice individually. 

Basic class structure:

1. Warm up and dynamic stretching;
2. Karate basics (kicking, punching, and blocking);
3. Detailed study (e.g.,generating power, stanches and posture, ...);
4. [Katas](/karate#katas) (patterns); and
5. Static stretching.

Instructors adapt the basic structure based on the experience of attendees.
